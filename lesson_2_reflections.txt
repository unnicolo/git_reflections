**Udacity course - How to use Git and Github**

**Lesson 2 reflections**

Question: What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository with `git init' git will add a hidden folder
named `.git' to the directory that now becomes a repository. This folder
contains all the files that are needed to maintain the commit history.

We need this so that we can keep track of the commit history. Otherwise it
would be just a folder with some files in it. Git has to know that the its
operations are supported.

Question: How is the staging are different from the working directory and
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the intermediate area between untracked files and tracked
files. Its purpose is to have fine-grained control of which files will be
present in a specific commit and which not. This allows to keep the changes
of a commit logically seperate from other commits. 

This concept offers great value because the user won't have to move files
just to exclude/include them from/to a commit. Also, it encourages the user to
think about how to structure the commit.
