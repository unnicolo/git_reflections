**Udacity course - How to Use Git and GitHub**

**Lesson 3 reflections**

Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is the prefered way of sharing the results of your work with others. It makes it easy to asynchronously work
on different tasks without always having to meet in some dark alley just to exchange USB sticks.

Also imagine that you're sitting at a different workstation. With a remote repository you can you get the current state of the project
even if you are not always working with the same computer.

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It might be the case that you are working on something on your local machine.
Then if Git always pulled the latest changes from the remote repository there
might arise conflicts with the work which has been done locally but not yet
commited and the pulled files.

Maybe for some reasone someone has pushed some commits which contain errors.
Then everyone would automatically get the versions with the errors rather than
having the chance to check if they really want it.
