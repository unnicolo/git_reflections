Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is the prefered way of sharing the results of your work with others. It makes it easy to asynchronously work
on different tasks without always having to meet in some dark alley just to exchange USB sticks.

Also imagine that you're sitting at a different workstation. With a remote repository you can you get the current state of the project
even if you are not always working with the same computer.
